# Movie Ticket Booking API - Spring Boot Project

This project is a Spring Boot implementation of the backend APIs for a movie ticket booking systemâ€”similar in spirit to platforms like BookMyShow. It provides a set of RESTful APIs that allow client applications (such as web or mobile apps) to interact with the system to perform various operations related to movie ticket booking.

## Features

- **User Management**
  - **User Registration & Login:** Users can create an account, log in, and manage their profile information.
  - **Role-based Access:** Differentiates between normal users (customers) and admin users. Admins have additional privileges like managing movies, theaters, and showtimes.

- **Movie Management**
  - **Admin Operations:** Admins can add, update, and delete movies.
  - **User Browsing:** Users can view the list of available movies.

- **Theater Management**
  - **Admin Operations:** Admins can add, update, and delete theaters.
  - **Theater Details:** Each theater includes its name, location, and seat capacity.

- **Showtime & Seat Management**
  - **Showtime Creation:** Admins can schedule showtimes for movies in specific theaters and screens.
  - **Seat Selection:** Users can view available seats for a given showtime and select their preferred seats.
  - **Ticket Booking:** Users can book tickets for a selected showtime, and the system ensures that booked seats are reserved.

- **Order & Payment Processing**
  - **Order Creation:** Users can create orders when booking tickets.
  - **Payment Processing:** Integrated payment APIs ensure that payments for ticket bookings (or food orders) are processed reliably. The operations are transactional so that, if any step fails, all changes are rolled back.

- **Food Ordering (Optional)**
  - **Food Menu Management:** Admins can manage food items available in theaters.
  - **User Orders:** Users can view the food menu and place orders along with their ticket bookings.

- **Booking History**
  - **Order Details:** Users can view their past bookings and payment details.
